# Contribute to OASIS

OASIS is a GitHub organization that serves as a third space for collaborative development. You can contribute in three ways:

- **Templates & Documentation** — repository scaffolds and formal guides used across projects.
- **Data Library** — copy-paste examples that download and plot data from a single source.
- **Analytics Library** — copy-paste method snippets that work generically across common data types.

Use the guides below for exact author requirements and checklists.

- → [Analytics Library](/how_to_contribute/contribute-analytics-library/)

## Why contribute
- Make your work reusable and discoverable.
- Help newcomers get from zero to plot quickly.
- Build shared capacity across labs and communities.

## What to expect
- Lightweight review for clarity, licensing, and runnable examples.
- Consistent formatting so others can build on your work.
